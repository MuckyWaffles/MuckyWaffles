## To C, or not to C

>"Why is Heart Attack taking so long?" - Kira Yoshikage, and me sometimes

If you do not agree with 5 of these, please leave (joke):
1. C is the best language
2. Open Source software is superior
3. Linux is the best operating system (or something Linux adjacent)
4. NeoVim is the best text editor (or something adjacent)
5. We must seize the means of production

### What do I do??? (real question)
- My best language is C, though I started with Python, and I'm fairly proficient in Zig...
You've heard of Zig before, right?
- I'm currently learning Zig, because I believe in it's capacity as the one true successor to C
(Not like that bloated C++ *garbage*)
- I want to start learning Rust again
- I'm working on a platformer, written in pure C - okay well I wrote a C++ wrapper for the DearImGui library - but mostly C.
It's called Pi Must Die, I've been working on it for years, and it's really cool, but the world isn't ready for it yet.
It uses the SDL3 library, thought it started with SDL2, and OpenGL3 for graphics.
- I waste a third of the time on my computer customizing it. (That's slightly hyperbole).
- On my main PC I use Arch Linux with Hyprland, and on my Thinkpad T420, I use Arch with Swaywm.
- I enjoy trying out funky browsers, ranging from terminal browsers like lynx or w3m to mostly normal browsers like
Zen (basically the Arc browser but on Firefox), Qutebrowser, Palemoon, Librewolf,
and even very W.I.P. ones like Ladybird and Servo.

### REAL LIFE HOBBIES???
- Playing guitar, occasionally writing music
- Playing games, (Dark Souls is the best game ever made, but I love myself some Terraria)
- Riding my bike (I like trains, and cars are overrated)
- Reading manga (What am I a weeb?)
- Writing fanfiction (If you recognize the quote at the top, yes, I write JoJo fanfic (ao3 account same username))
- I dabble in Japanese...
